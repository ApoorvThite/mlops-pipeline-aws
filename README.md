# 🔁 Automated MLOps Pipeline on AWS

An end-to-end MLOps pipeline that trains, deploys, and monitors a machine learning model using AWS SageMaker. This project demonstrates best practices in CI/CD for ML systems, leveraging the power of automation for robust model management in production environments.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project sets up a fully automated MLOps pipeline using:

- **AWS SageMaker** for model training and hosting  
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD  
- **S3** for data and artifact storage  
- **SageMaker Model Monitor** for automated model quality tracking  
- **IAM & OIDC** for secure role-based access control

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

We build a binary classification model using Scikit-learn to solve a supervised ML task, and:

1. Train the model via **SageMaker training jobs**
2. Automatically deploy the model to an endpoint
3. Continuously monitor the model’s prediction drift and performance degradation using **Model Monitor**

## 🔧 How to Run

### 1. 🔑 Prerequisites

- AWS Account with SageMaker, S3, and IAM permissions
- S3 bucket created (e.g., `apoorvawsbucket321`)
- AWS CLI configured locally (`aws configure`)
- Python 3.8+ with `boto3`, `sagemaker`, `joblib`

### 2. 📦 Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. 🚂 Start Training

```bash
python sagemaker_train_deploy.py
```

4. 🌐 Deploy Endpoint

Edit sagemaker_deploy_endpoint.py and set:

```bash
python sagemaker_deploy_endpoint.py
```

---

## ✅ Results

The trained model achieved:

- **Accuracy:** ~76%
- **F1-Score:** 0.75 (macro average)
- **Model File:** `model.joblib` (saved locally and uploaded to S3)
- **Deployed Endpoint:** Successfully created on AWS SageMaker and ready for inference via REST API

---

## 📈 What's Next

- ✅ **Integrate Model Monitor** for real-time drift detection  
- ✅ **Set up GitHub Actions** for full CI/CD automation  
- ⏳ **Add real-time prediction script** to send requests to the endpoint  
- ⏳ **Create a Streamlit UI** for easy user interaction  


Let me know if you'd like me to add:
- Diagrams (architecture/CI flow)
- Badges (e.g. deployment status)
- GitHub Actions workflow YAML
- Live demo links

I'm happy to help polish the final version!
