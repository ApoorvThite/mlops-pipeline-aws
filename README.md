# üîÅ Automated MLOps Pipeline on AWS

An end-to-end MLOps pipeline that trains, deploys, and monitors a machine learning model using AWS SageMaker. This project demonstrates best practices in CI/CD for ML systems, leveraging the power of automation for robust model management in production environments.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project sets up a fully automated MLOps pipeline using:

- **AWS SageMaker** for model training and hosting  
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD  
- **S3** for data and artifact storage  
- **SageMaker Model Monitor** for automated model quality tracking  
- **IAM & OIDC** for secure role-based access control

## üß† Problem Statement

We build a binary classification model using Scikit-learn to solve a supervised ML task, and:

1. Train the model via **SageMaker training jobs**
2. Automatically deploy the model to an endpoint
3. Continuously monitor the model‚Äôs prediction drift and performance degradation using **Model Monitor**
